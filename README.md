# Benchmark-For-Underwater-Image-Dataset
+ Brackish: https://www.kaggle.com/aalborguniversity/brackish-dataset | [BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1aCcXwfUYpW-Mpmz9bQ0WEw) 88ms
+ URPC: http://www.cnurpc.org/

The original brackish dataset contains many images of no targets by observing the annotations_YOLO/xxx.txt file, so we filtered these images and split to trainval and test indexes by the ratio of 9/1.

The adopted URPC dataset removed seadweeds class and filtered images that had no annotations too.

The final split results are just references because of possible training errors caused by the origin data.
